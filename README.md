# The experiments
Over the past few years, my computer has accumulated a lot of experiments and little projects. Because I find some really interesting, I would like to share with others. So this is a small collection of interesting codes, primarily in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

Here it the list:

<strong>Drawing of SVG path by scrolling</strong>
<br />
<strong>Video kaleidoscope</strong>
<br />
<strong>Arctangen balls in space</strong>
<br />
<strong>Blender 2 HTML</strong>
