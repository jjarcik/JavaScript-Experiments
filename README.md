# The JQuery experiments (deprecated)
Over the past few years, my computer has accumulated a lot of experiments and little projects. Because I find some really interesting, I would like to share with others. So this is a small collection of interesting codes, primarily in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

Here it the list:
